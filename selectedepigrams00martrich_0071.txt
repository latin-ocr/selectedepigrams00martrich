V. 9.

 

On Symmachus, a physieiam and his medical students‚ who appear
to have made use of the poet as a sort of corpus vile to experiment upon.

Came Symmachus to ease my pain,

A hundred pupils in his train.

A hundred hands, with Boreas numbed,
My wrist befingered and bethumbed.
Fever, sir leeeh, before I had none 3

But now I've got a very bad one.⁷
