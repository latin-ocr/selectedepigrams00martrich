' On the cruel punishment inflicted by a Roman lady upon her tire-
: r-„woman with a hand-mittor of polished metal. The poet says she deserves
§to have her head shaved for being a maniae. '1 he Romans fancied that the
{touch of a salamander would make the hair drop off.

Of all the ringlets that within

The head's encircling cluster21ie,

Ill—fastened by a faltering pin,
⁷ A single curl had slipped awry. ¹

’ With the same glass in which she spies
This fault, the fair her vengeance sped.
Beneath the blow Plecusa lies, .

Struck down with bruised and bleeding head.

Hencefclrward eaeh ill-omened tress
Let Lalage disordered wear3 ⁸
And never more may handmaid dress

The locks of such a maniac's hair.

Let salamander mar their grace,
Or iuthless razor shave them clean ;
That so the mirrored form we trace*

May match the glass in which 'tis seen.
