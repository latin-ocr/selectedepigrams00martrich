vn, 96,

On the death of Bassus’s infant child, Urbicus. The three Sister-F ates
were goddesses who presided over the lives and destinies of men. So in
Milton’s Lycidas,

“ Comes the blind Fury with the abhorred shears,
And slits the thiu-span life.''

 

’ For me, the little UrbicuS, has earth
Beneath this marble stone provided room.
Rome's mighty city gave me name and birth,

And Bassus weeps above his infant's tomb.

My first three years of youthful life to fill,
Six little months there -yet remained to run,
What time the Sisters‚ with relentless will,

Snapt the thin thread with which my days were spun.

Ah, what availed me then my childish grace,

My merry ,prattling tongue‚ and infant years?
Who read'st these lines that mark my resting-place,

Give to my grave the tribute of thy tearS.

·' So may not he, whom thou would'st keep alive
To hand thy lineage down :among mankind,
Pass to cold Lethe’s stream, but still survive,
Till even old Nestor's years are left behind.
