Martial complains that Postumianus’s gifts to him at the Saturnalia (some-
thing like our Christmas boxes) had decreased year by year. He had gone
“from a pound to a pin ’' as Speed says in the Two Gentlemen of Verona.

Four pounds of silver at the least,

A present at the winter feast,
Postumianus, well Ι know,

You sent me just ten years ago.

The next year, as I hoped for more
(For gifts than those that went before
Should larger be, or else the same),
About two pounds was all that came.
The third year and the fourth, more ill,
Brought with, them cheaper presents still.
And on the fifth, 'tis sad to state,

One pound was given, and that short weight.
An eight-ounce dish the sixth brought round,
A cup the next, a bare half-pound.

The eighth year sent, my board to bless,
A ,spoon that weighed two ounces leSS. '
N ext year an egg-spoon was my fate,
And lighter than a bodkin’s weight.

What now, with the tenth year in vieW,
Postumianus, will you do?

You cannot give me leSS‚ 'tis plain.
Return to those four pounds again.
