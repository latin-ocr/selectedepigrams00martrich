XI. 91. ἶ

On a favourite little slave-girl, who died of cancer in the lip.

Little Aeolian Canace
Lies buried 'neath this marble floor. -‚

Seven winters did the maiden see,

And aster them no winter more.

“Ah bitter fate, ah timeless bane!’'
Nay, mourn not thus, kind passer—by.
Enough, we may not here complain

T hat she, while yet so young, should die.

For cruel cancer's hateful doom
Her child—face wasted in its ire,

Devoured her kisses’ fragrant bloom,

Nor left whole lips to grace her pyre.

Twice sad is death that comes like this:

For if the Fates were purposed still
To seize with sudden swoop, I wis

There yet were other ways to kill.

But Death with hasty footsteps went
To close the doors of speech, sor sear
T hose cruel goddesses relent‚

If her sweet voice should reach their ear.
