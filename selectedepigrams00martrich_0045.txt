ΙΙ. 75.

On one of the trained lions of the amphitheatre. The poet recom-
mends to it the example of the wolf 'of the Capitol, which suckled Romulus
and Remus.

λς’] Α lion, wont to bear the blows
His fearless master's rod bestows,
So tame that he would quiet stand,
While in his jaws you thrust your hand,
, Sudden forgot his peaceful ways,
And such a fierceness here displays
. As had ‘disgraced his Libyan lair,
For two among the boyS, whose care
It was with rakes to hide from sight
The bloody traces of the fighss
The savage wretch in pieces tore.
Rome's amphitheatre before
Ne'er saw so fell a deed as this.
Thus to exclaim 'twere not amiss 2—-
“Traitor‚ that dost such ravine dare,

From our own wolf learn boys to spare !''
