⁷· *v VI. 52. ⁷

On the death of Pantagathus, a young and elever barber, and probably
a slave of the poet's.

Here lies, cut off in youthful bloom,
Pantagathus in saddest tomb.

He knew each straggIIng hair to clip,

And trim the shaggy chin or lip 3

And with such skill his scissors sped,
You'd think he scarcely touched your head.
However lighssy, as ’tis just,

Thou, earth, may’st lie above his dust‚

I ween thou canst not lighter be

Than with those nimble hands was he.

NV VI. 57·

On one who painted hair on his bald scalp with black ointment. See
ῗ Introduction, p. xiii.. ’

ξ Your head with unguents you besmear,
And ’ counterfeited locks appear.

And, Phoebus, with this painted hair
You cover all the part that's bare. ⁷
No need of scissors for this head3

A sponge will shave it clean instead.
