Χ] V. 47.

A joke on one who boasted of his numerous invitations td dinner.

Philo is courted so at Rome,
He swears he never dines at home.
Yes 3 if no friend invites him out,

The wretch is forced to go without.

*s V. 74.

Cneius and Sextus, the two sons of Pompey the Great, were killed, one

of them in Spain, and the other at Miletus in Asia; while the father
himself was assassinated in Africa at Alexandria.

Europe and Asia each contain
The bones of Pompey's children slain.
For him doth Afric's soil give room,

If Pompey found indeed a tomb.

A ruin of a bulk so vast
Could not within one spot be cast:

What wonder, then, the fragments hurled

ἱ Were scattered over all the world?
