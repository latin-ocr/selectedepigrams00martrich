An epitaph on -the parents of Domitian's architect, Rabirius.

ἶ Thou who for parents of thine own would’st prize
A death so happy and so long delayed,

ζ’. Gaze on this marble’s verse with loving eyes:
For here Rabirius in the earth has laid

His own, departed. Is there aged pair

3Can boast a lot that may with theirs compare?

,.-ζ One night, at last, by death unmixed with pain,

-ss Closed the full sum of sixty nuptial years 3

And, dead, one funeral pile received the twain.

Yet he complains with fond regretful tearS,

sss· As though he mourned them snatched in youthful bloom.

Enough 'tis wrong to weep o’ er such a tomb.
