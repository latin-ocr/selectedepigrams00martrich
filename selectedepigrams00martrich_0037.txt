ΙΙ. 29.

Ἴ On one who, once a slave, had become a fine gentleman, and sat in
fam front benches of the theatre‚ wearing the red shoe with C-shaped
:ornament that denoted the Roman Senator. The man had taken advantage
-qf the fashion of wearing patches‚ common in a later day at the court os

Queen Anne, to conceal the brandmarks on his forehead. Marcellus was
the Rimmel of his time.

Friend Rufus, yonder man you see,

Who in the front seats lounges free,

And doth even here a glitter fling

From that sardonyx in his ring.

His mantle, with its gorgeous dye,

Must oft have drained Tyre's riches dry. Tyre's
His toga too such care doth show, „

'Tis whiter than⁸Qrcdden snow.

So strong his greasy cdours spread,

 

Sure all Marcellus scents his head:
And shine his arms, all smooth and bare,
Plucked clean of each disfiguring hair„
Fresh every day a riband new

Makes fast his crescent-mounted shoe 3
Which, gay with red morocoe, still
Softly protects his foot from ill:

While spangling patche5‚ by the score,
Besmear his plastered forehead o'er.
What fellow's this, ask you P—You need
But lift those patcheS‚ then you'll read.
