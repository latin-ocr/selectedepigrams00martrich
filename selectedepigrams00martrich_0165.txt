invitation to dinner. See Introduction, p. x. 'J

Or in the baths or loitering round

All day Menogenes is found.

Go, practise every art you please,

You won't escape Menogenes.

When flies the ball, alert he'll stand,
And catch it deft with either hand,
That you may have to thank his skill,
Which saved you thus from stooping still.
He⁷11 fetch you with the greatest gust
The flabby football soiled with dust‚
Although he's sandalled, spruce and fine,
All ready to go out to dine.

You take your towel: at the sight,

Cries he, “Was ever shnow so white?'’
T hough all the while, (so bare's the fib),
'Tis dirtier than an infant's bib.

Arranging next with tooth of wood
Your scanty locks as best he should,

The man, in raptures‚ will declam,
“I’1n.'cornbing, sure, Achilles' hair !⁷'
From smoke-stained jar he'll fetch you in
Wine-lees himself to smear your skin3
And with officious haste allow

No sweat unwiped upon your brow.
Admiring all, intent to please, ⁷

He praises everything he sees;
Till, sick with thousand meddlings past,
“Pray come and dine,’' you cry at last.
