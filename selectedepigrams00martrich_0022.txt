most of his epigrams we're published during the reign of
Domitian, who highly esteemed him as an author. His fre·
quent allusions to the sports of the amphitheatre‚ its tarne lions ἕ
and performing bulls (see pp. 7, 21), were no doubt prompted
by a desire to please that emperor, who took the greatest
interest in these exhibitions. His writings were very popular
at Rome, and seem, in consequence, to have become the prey
of plagiarists‚ against whom several of his bitterest epigrams
are directed. Success also rendered him liable to the attacks
of jealous and captious critics‚ as we find from the poerns on
pp. 19, 23, 73 of this selection. We may note here that Mar—
tial’s wit but seldom has recourse to plays upon wordS. At the
close of a poem previously referred to ¹ he puns on the Latin
words praedium and prandium, pastura and repa'st, as we may
perhaps translate them 3 in another ²‚.lzaliculam, capes, is⁰ pitted
in the same way against halicarn, capers; whil'e in a third ⁸, he
jocosely points out to the barber Cinnamus, who was anxious to
shorten his freedman's name into the Roman one of Cinna, that
' on the 'same principle the name Furius would straightway be
metamorphosed into fur, a thies. The epigram may perhaps
be rendered as follows:

‘⁶ Why, Cinnamus, I do not know
The name of Cinna you prefer.
Suppose your name were Roberts—so
You’d straight become a robber‚ sir!'’
It is a curious fact, as has been remarked elsewhere, that
a written copy of one of Martial’s books could be bought

considerably cheaper than a printed one could nOW, vi2. for
