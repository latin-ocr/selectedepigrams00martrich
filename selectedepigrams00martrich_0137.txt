1x. 93. s

On drinking to the health of Domitian. See Introduction, p. xiii.

Nay‚ Calocissus‚ why refrain

To pour the ambrosial draught again?
Three times again and three times stin
My cup with old Falernian fill.

Now tell me, to what form divine

Six times I bid thee pour the wine?
See, ’tis our (iaesas's name. And now
Ten times let roses wreath my brow ;
And so we make his title plain,

Who hallowed erst the F lavian fane.
Now, prythee, twice five kisses give,
That ever thus that name may live—
The name our godlike hero bore

A victor from the Odrysian shore. ’
