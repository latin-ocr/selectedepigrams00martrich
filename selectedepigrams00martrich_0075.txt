V. 37.

⁴ On the same subject as the previous epigram. The Romans admired
a fair complexion and flaxen or auburn hair. It was customary with the

Roman ladies to carry balls of amber to cool the hands; these when ’

-warmed gave out a scent.

Maiden, more sweet to me than swans-down grey,
Softer than lambs that by Galaesus play,
More elegant than pearl of Lucrine shell,
Nor Persia’s diamonds are preferred so well,
’ So white not India’s new-cut ivory shows,
The ungathered lily, or fresh—fallen snowsr
Whose looks, than fleece of Baetic flock more fair,
Surpass the Teuton's knotted length of hair,
‘Or gold-furred dormouse: to whose lips their scent
Was by sweet rose of Paestum’s garden lent,
Or lately-handled amber's fragrant smell,
Or the first-fruits of Attic honey-cell:
Compared with whom nor seemed the peacock fair,
The squirrel lovesorne, nor the phoenix rare—
In her fresh tomb‚ scarce cold, Erotion lies,

Whom bitter fate cut off with cruel spite
