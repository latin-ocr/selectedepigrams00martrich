V. 79.

γ Martial ridicules Zoilus for frequently changing his dress during dinner ¹

on the pretence of being afraid ⁷<of catching cold, but really in order
to display his extensive wardrobe. ’

Eleven timeS, Zoilus, at one sitting,
I've watched you from the table flitting 3
Eleven times over, while you dine,
You shift your suit of mantles fine;
Lest perspiration, that should cling
Within their folds, a dampness fling,

- Which might your open pores expose
To any little draught that blows.
Then, Zoilus, why do I, who sit
Beside you, not perspire a bit?
Because a single suit, I wiS,

Has very cooling propertieS.
