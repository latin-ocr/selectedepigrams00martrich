{s The old language of adulation paid. to the Emperor Domitian will not,
Qsssfil„ the poet, rneet with the approval of his successor Nerva. Compli·
ents are personified, and represented as secking admission to their old
unts.

In vain now, Compliments‚ ye come
With worn floor·kissing lips3 adieu.
Of god and master I am dumb,

There's no more room in town for you.

Hence to the Parthian's turbaned court,

 

And low your suppliant bodies fling3
Kneel there, and, so servilely taught,
Go, kiss the sole of gay-robed king.

No master's here, but soldier-chief,
»And perfect statesman just and fair 3
Who brings from Stygian realm of grief ’

Truth, rustic maid, with unkempt hair.

If you have wisdom for your day,
Beware you utter, Rome, no more,
Beneath this prince’s manly sway,

Those flattering words you used before.
