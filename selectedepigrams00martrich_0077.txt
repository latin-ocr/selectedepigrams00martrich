In her sixth winter, nor that finished quite,

The pet and playmate-darling of my eyes,
And yet my grief friend Paetus bids me spare,

And beats his‘breast like me and tears his hair.

“Art not ashamed to mourn a slave-girl dead?
“ Why, I have just interred my wife‚'' he said,
“Distinguished‚ stately‚ and of high degree,
“And wealthy, yet survive.'' Did e'er ye see
Such fortitude, my friends, in all your lives?

- Two hundred thousand gained, he yet survives.

Ὢ v. 43.

In ridicule of the custom of wearing false teeth.

Thais for black, Laecania
For snow-white teeth is known.
For why? Laecania's teeth were bought,

While T hais wears her own.
