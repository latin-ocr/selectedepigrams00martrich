On Erotion, a little slave-girl and pet of the poet’s‚ who died before she

    

was quite six years old. In the second line, the allusion is to Cerberus,
the three-headed watch-dog of Hades.

To you—dun spectres to forefend
And yon T artarean monster dread—-
This little maiden I commend,

Dead parents of my darling dead!

Had only my Erotion's span,
While just so many days were told,
Been lengthened out to dwell with man,

She had been then six winters old.

Still sportive may she spend her dayS‚
And lisp my name with prattling tongue 3
Nor chide her little wanton ways,

Mid friends so old, and she so young.

Soft be the turf *that shrouds her bed,
For delicate and soft was she.

And, Earth, lie lightly o'er her head,
For light the steps she laid on thee.
