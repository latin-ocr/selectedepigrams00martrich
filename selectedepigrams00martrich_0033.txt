Unsightly bisons waggons trail,

Nor does the monstrous tusker fail
His nimble dances to afford‚

At hidding of his sable lord:—

Who would not say that this would be
A pageant fit for gods. to see?

Yet he who once the lions viewed—
The lowly chase by them pursued,
Which hares fatigue with timorous speed—-
These lesser sights would little heed.
They now release, now hunt, at will,
And catch them but to fondle still ;
And in the lion's mouth the hare

F eels safer, since it is his care
Loosely to close his jaws, and so
Allow his prey to come and go,

And keep his cautious fangs from blame
Of outrage3 for he holds it shame,
From heifer’s slaughter come, to tear
So weak a quarry as a hare.

It is not through the trainer's art

The lions play this gentle part:

But 'tis because to them ’tis known
How kind is he whose rule they own.
