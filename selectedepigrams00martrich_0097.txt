VI. 65.

 

The poet satirizes Tucca’s want of taste, who objected to long epigrams,
s and to their being written in the hexameter metre.

: “This poet in hexameters his epigrams composes.’'

Why, Tucca, this is often done 3 besides, what law opposes?

“But this-one, see, what length is here!” This, sir, is often
done too:

Π you prefer them shorter‚ there are distiches to run t0.

skip them.
