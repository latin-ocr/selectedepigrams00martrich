VI. 42.

The poet praises the elegant baths of Claudius Etruscus. See
Introduction, p. ix.

If you have ne’er a visit paid

To those hot baths Etruscus made—-
Should, Oppianus, this be 80,

Down to the grave unwashed you'll go.

None else such grateful warmth diffuse:

Patavium's‚ which no ladies use,

Nor balmy Sinuessa's spring,

Or pleasant heat that Passer‘s bring3
Caere's, or those on Anxur’s erest,

Or Baiae's, noted as the best.

So bright the sky, so pure the air,
Even daylight loves to linger there 3
And veil of night's o'ershadowing pall
Does nowhere else so gradual fall.
There mines of Taygetus supply
Their green-hued marbles 3 with them vie
Phrygia's‚ with rich and varied stains,

And those deep-hewn from Libya's veins.
