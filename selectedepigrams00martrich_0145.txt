In praise of the poetess Sulpicia, and her love for her husband Calenus.

By all our wives Sulpicia's read and known,

Who wish to win their husbands’ love alone.

By all our husbands is Sulpicia read,

Who only wish to please the wives they've wed.
Medea's rage she loves not to record,

Or the fell banquet of Thyestes’ board3

And as for Scylla, Byblis, and the rest,

Believes they’re nothing more than myths at best.

Affection chaste and true her notes employS‚

“ And lovers' sprightly talk and frolic j0yS.

Who reads her book and rightly values it,
Would say she won the palm alike for wit
And modesty. Old Numa thus, Ι wot,

Toyed with Egeria 'neath their dripping grot.
Sappho, with her as school-fellow or guide,
More ⁸learned had you been and chaste beside:
But had hard-hearted Phaon seen the two,
Sulpicia had been loved instead of you.

But loved in vain: for not as wife of Jove,

Or Bacchus' or Apollo's bridal love,

Would she have lived, if once the Fates should par-t
Her dear Calenus from her widowed beart.
