X. 97.

A witty statement of a disappointment in an expected legacy.

With rushes strewn the funeral pile
All lightly laid for kindling lies 3
Casia and myrrh his weeping wife
For her expiring husband buys:
The grave is dug, the bier prepared,
Ι The anointer with his drugs attends;
When Numa, as a last resource,

Makes me his heir, and straight he mendS.

XI. 41.

On the death of Amyntas, killed by a fall from a tree. The poet warns
ν his own herdsman not to run a similar risk.

κ The swain AmyntaS, to his herd too kind,
Proud of their good repute and lusty show,
Broke through the ‘o‘erladen boughs with acorns lined,
-Following himself the wealth he showered below.
His sire, lest it survive so dire a fall,
To seed his pyre condemned that fatal tree.
Our neighbours‚ Lygdus, fat their swine may call;

To count my flock is all I ask of thee.
