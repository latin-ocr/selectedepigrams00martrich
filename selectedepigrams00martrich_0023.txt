INTRODUCTJON. XV

¹about fourpence half-penny, and that with a profit to the book-
seller, as he expressly mentions ¹. Apart from the grossness of
some of his verses, the poet’s chief weakness lay in the spirit
of abject flattery that marks his allusions to Domitian. This,
however, was the vice of his day, a fawning servility being· the
only road to favour with such a ruler‚ beneath whose sway any
independence of character on the part of a man of note was
likely to eost him his life. His language in Ep. x. 72, p. 127,
shows the bound of relief he felt at being freed from such a
system.

These few explanatory remarks, with the headings prefixed
to each of the translations, will, it is hoped, render this

selection of Martial's Epigrams fully intelligible to the English ,

reader. The author's text has been placed side by side with
the translation, for the benefit of those readers who are students
of Latin. To such it is an additional pleasure to be able
readily to compare the original with the English version.
