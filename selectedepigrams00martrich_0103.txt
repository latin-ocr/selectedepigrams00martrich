Of potted grapes it holds a few,

A handful of pomegranates too,

And paunch of sow, all stuffed and drest‚
Lies all unsightly mid the rest:

A fig half-eaten from the plate,

And mnshrooms in a pulpy state.

His napkin now, wherein dispersed

Lie countless thefts‚ is like to burst:

So in his sweaty gown he’ll hide

Some nibbled marrow-bones beside.

O’er a wood·pigeon next 'tis spread ;
But first, for show, he eats the head.
Nor thinks it shame to aid his store
With scattered fragments from the fioor ;
And gatherS, straining to the ground,
What’s leftby sweeper and by hound.
Nor, such a greedy maw to stuff,

Are pilfered eatables enough:

For at his feet a flagon lies,

Which he with tempered wine supplies.

All these when home, oppressed with careS,

He'd carried up six flights of stairs,
And shut himself within his hold,
On the next day our glutton-sold,
