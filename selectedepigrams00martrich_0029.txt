Ι. 88.

On the grave of a favourite slave-boy‚ who had died young in the
poet's house. The open space that fringed the high-roads round the city
formed the Roman cemeteries.

Torn from thy master’s home by fate,
Loved youth, in beauty's opening bloom‚·
No Parian marble's tottering weight

With transient splendour marks thy tomb.

For thee, beside Labican way,
The box her pliant branches ream,
And there the vine’s dark shadows play

O’er grass that’s dewy with my tears.

Accept‚ dear youth, what grief has done:
Thus lasting honour shalt thou crave.
I ask, when Fate my life has spun,

That such as these may deck my grave.
