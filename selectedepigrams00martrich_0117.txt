On a libation-vessel (a round flat dish or bowl originally employed in

sacrificing to the gods), which had been presented to the poet by Instantius ,

Rufus. The epigram is valuable as illustrating ancient art. For the
‘ Roman method of drinking healths‚ see Introduction, p. xii.

This bowl did Myron fashion, or Mys’s art divine?

i Ὀι· is it Mentor's handiwork, or, Polyclitus, thine?

No dim discolouring stain did e'er its lustrous hue deface‚

‘Nor doth it sear the crucible, like metal dull and base.

Here than the pure electrum more yellow-bright ’tis seen,

There, frosted—rich, 'tis cornelier far than ivory's snow-white
sheen.

³ Nor less the skill that shaped its ore: the moon, what time
her light

Shines full, encloses not an orb more perfect or more bright.

*Within, a ram, with such a fleece as Phrixus once possessed,

[Stands graved so fair, his sister had on this preferred to rest.

ι Cinyphian shearers had not dared to touch a fleece so fine,

And, Bacchus, with thy leave this ram had pastured on thy
vine.

J Cupid upon his back astride‚ with golden wings arrayed,

Holds to his infant lips the pipe that Pallas erst essayed.

Even so Arion Lesbian-sprung upon the dolphin rode,

T hat o'er the sleeping ocean bore with joy its tuneful load.
