To Ligurinas, who, though a man of blameless character, put everybody
to flight with his perpetual recitations. See Introduction, p. x.

Why everybody shuns your sight,
And why, since all are put to ssight,
Wherever your approach is viewed,
The place is one vast solitude :—
This, Ligurinus, would you know?
You' re too poetical, Ι trow
Γ ls dangerous having this repnte.
Not savage tigress in pursuit
Of them that stole her whelps away,
Not serpent, scorched by buming ray
Of Libya's sun, not scorpion fell
Is deemed by all so terrible.
For, prythee tell me, who could bear
The burdens you for folk prepare?
Should Ι stand by, your rhymes you read 3
Or if I sit, you still proceed.
To the hot baths I fly for sear:
You din your verses in my ear.
Ch s thence, I seek the plunge-bath's brim:
B t, while you’re ranting‚ who could swim?
To dinner then I haste: alack!
Just as Ι start, you hold me. back.
The table reached, I fain would eat:
You scare'me as I take my seat.
· Quite wearied out, to sleep I try:
You rouse me ere I down can lie.
Shall I, my friend, make plain to you
What serious mischief 'tis you do?
All sear you still, and fly you far,
Good, upright, blameless as you are.
