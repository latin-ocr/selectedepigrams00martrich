III. 46.

Martial satirically suggests that his steward is better fitted than himself
to perform the duties expected of a client. See Introduction, p. xi.

Day after day you still demand

A client's duties at my hand.

I still decline your call to attend,

But in my stead my steward send.
“That's quite another thing,’' say you.
That 'tis far more I’ll prove it true.

I toil behind your litter's state:

He'll lend his shoulder to the weight.
Should jostling crowds your path surround,
With elbow raised he'll hold his ground:
Unfit for such a fray, my chest

Is delicate and weak at best.

However well you plead your suit,

I in the court shall sit quite mute:
Whereas my fellow forth will roar

His ready bravos by the score.

Have you a quarrel? Ever bold,

In voice of thunder he will scold:
While shame to me forbids the use

Of boisterous accents of abuse.

“Then will you, after all,'' say you,
“To prove your friendship nothing do? ⁷²
I'll give you, sir, my love to show,
That which a steward can't bestow.
