*V VI. 51.

κ To an inhospitable friend of the poet’s. The man was so stingy that
.Martial knew he would rather have his invitation refused.

LupercuS‚ you're so mean a sinner‚

You never ask your friend to dinner.

To serve you out I know the way.
Hereafter you may beg and pray,

And, to appease my indignafion,

Send fifty times an invitation:

You'll see my wrath how hot I've kept it.
What will I do, you ask P-—Accept it. A
