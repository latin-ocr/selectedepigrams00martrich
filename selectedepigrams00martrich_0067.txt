IV. 69.

Papilus, who was famous for his good cellar, supplied from the

so that a report got about that his wines were poisoned. Compare Ep. IV.

v⁴14» 12- 39·
On Massic and Setinian fares
The guest that banquets in your hall.

Them not so wholesome after alL
’Tis said t‘hat by that wine-jar you
Four times became a widower. Thus

Nor am I thirsty, Papilus.
