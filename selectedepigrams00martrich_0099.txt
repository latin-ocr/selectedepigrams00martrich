On the artificial growth of roses at„ Rome, thus rendering their
importation from Egypt in winter no longer necessary.

Caesar, to thee the land of Nile had sent
Her winter roses with officious care,
Thinking to give thee something new and rare.
But when to Rome the Pharian sailor went,
Soon as he passed within her walls' extent,
F orthwith he scorned his Memphian gardens fair3
Such splendour as of Paestum's fields was there,
Such vernal beauty, and such balmy‘ scent.
Where'er around his roaming footsteps stray,
And wheresoe'er his wondering glauces bend,
With rose—twined garlands every street was gay. ·
Then, Egypt, since no more thou canst pretend
To match our Roman winters, hither send

Thy corn3 the gift our roses shall repay.
