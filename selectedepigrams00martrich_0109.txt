VII. 61.

It appears that the Roman tradesmen had been accustomed to erect
booths in frontof their shops sor the sale of their wareS. Domitian is praised
by Martial for putting a stop to this nuisance.

So bold had every huckster grown,

An Rome they'd taken as their own.
And even the threshold of their door
For them a limit was no more.
Germanicus, it was thy charge

To bid our narrowed streets enlarge3 —
And where a footpath erst had been,

A spacious road once more was seen.
Not tavern-post is now o'erhung

With flagons by their chains upstrung ;
Nor does the praetor now require
Mid-street to walk through mud and mire. ,
Nor careless roves the razor there,
Unsheathed in crowded thoroughfare 3
Nor cookshops, blaek with smoky heat,
Line all the road and blockr the street.
Withffi the bounds they late forsook'
Keep barber, vintner, butcher, cook 3
And what was one huge shop before

Is now become our Rome once more.
