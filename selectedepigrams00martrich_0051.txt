 

V 111. 18.

On one who prefaced his recitations with an apology for his hoarseness.

7 “We shall only be too glad‚'' says the poet, “to excuse you from reading
your poems to us at all.'' See Introduction, p. x.

You tell us, ere you read a verse,
Your throat is bad, your cold is worse.
Since you've excused yourself, my friend,

Shut up your book and make an end.

Nix 111. 43.

On an old fop who dyed his hair. According to Roman superstition,
Proserpine, queen os Hades‚ cut off a lock from a person's head at death.

Laetinus‚ fain to cheat men's eyes,

You smear your head with umber dyes3
And, late a swan as Whilt? as snow, ⁴
You've suddenly become a crow.

Is every one deceived by you?

No, one can tell the genuine hue.
Proserpine knows your hair is grey‚

And she will tear that mask away.
