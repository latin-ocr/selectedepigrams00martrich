On the little son of Regulus, a famous pleader at Rome.

The little Regulus behold,

Wh0‚ not as yet quite three years old,
Listens and joins with boyish fire
Himself to applaud his famous sire.
Soon as that father he perceiveS‚

At once his mother's lap he leaveS,

And by his childish pride makes known
He counts his praises as his own.

Him‚ though so young, the Court and sight
Of judges in their robes delight 3

Nor does the dense surrounding crowd
Affright him with their clamours loud.
So does the soal of generous horse
Exulting eye the thronging course;

The calf, with such a keen delight,
With tender horn attempts the fight.
Hear me, kind Heaven, and be thy care
A father's and a mother’s prayer :—
That he may to his son give ear,

That she both son and sire may hear.
