 

L V. 76.

Mithridates, King of Pontus, was said to have taken poisons by way of

precaution, that his constitution might become inured against them. The
poet jocosely says that Cinna, in keeping such a poor table, is evidently
trying to do something similam

Drug-proof old Mithridates grew
By frequent poisonous potation.
So with spare diet, Cinna, you

Ensure yourself against starvation.
