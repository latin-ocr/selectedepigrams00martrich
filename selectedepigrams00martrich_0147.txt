X. 47.

To a friend, Julius Martialis, telling him in what a happy life consists.
The gown, or toga (like our tall hat), was worn by the Romans in the city
and on state occasions, and thrown off in the country.

These, Martial, are the things that give
’ Α happier life than most men live.

A fortune not by labour won‚

But left by father to his son;

A farm that yields no scant returns,
A hearth that ever brightly burns;

No law-suits, no beart-vexing cares ς

 

Α gown its owner seldom wears 3
A constitution firmly knit,
And healthy frame accompanying it 3
An honest candour, yet discreet‚
With friends congenial and meet ς
Good-natured guests your joys to share,
A plain and unpretentious fare 3
No nights whose hours in revel pass,
Yet not uncheered by social glass3
A spouse of chaste yet merry sort ,-
Sound sleep that makes the darkness short;
A mind so well contented grown,

“ It thinks no lot excels its own 3
So blest, you neither wish nor sear

³· To see the closing hour draw near.
