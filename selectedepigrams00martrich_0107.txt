VII. 54.

The poet under his own name satirizes Roman superstition.

Each mom, to cause me sear and doubt,

You say 'tis Ι you've dreamed about.

Now last year's wines have reached their dregs,

While yonder¹ witch my safety begs 3
With this year’s too ’tis just as bad,
To exorcise those dreams you've had.
Oft have I salt-cake offerings sent,
And frankincense in heaps I've spent 3
My flock of sheep' alas! grows small,
While frequent lambs as victims fall.
My pigs, my fowIs, my eggs run out.
Either, my friend, take care to keep
Awake, or, if you needs must sleep,

Mind 'tis yourself you dream about.
