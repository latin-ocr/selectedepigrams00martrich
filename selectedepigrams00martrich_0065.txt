 

IV. 59.

On a viper enclosed in amber. The Heliades were three sisters, who
were so inconsolable at the death of their brother Phaeton that they were
changed by the gods into poplars and their tears into amber-

A viper o'er some branches crept

Moist with the tears the Heliads wept.

A drop of amber‚ as he passed,

Came trickling down, and held him fast.
ι And while the creature’s wonder grew,

. Thus caught and clogged with resinous dew,
The hardening juice its victim sealed,
As though in icy bonds congealed.
Then, Cleopatra, boast no more
The pomp that marks thy burial floor 3
Since here a viper lies, thy doom,

Interred within a nobler tomb.
