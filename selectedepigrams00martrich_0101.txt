V To a would-be fellow poet.

Why, sir, I don't my verses send you,
Pray, would you have the reason known?
The reason is—for sear, my friend, you
Should send me, in return, your own.

Rs VII. 20.

On Santra, whose avarice was even greater than his gluttony.'

At once so greedy and so mean

As Santra nothing e'er was seen.

When he—the fruit. of ceaseless pains—
At length an invitation gains

To a grand dinner, off he goes.

Once there, no modesty he knows.
T-wice helped to titbits from the boar,
He'll send his plate again for more.
Next four times he’ll demand a share
Of breast3 for both the legs of hare
And both the wings he’ll ask, nor blush
To swear they didn’t hand him thrush.
Then‚ snatching from his neighbour's plate
Pale oysters' ‚beards that others hate, Ι
He tucks his greasy napkin o'er‚

And adds a sweet cake to the store.
