· FOR ENGLJSJJ READERS. 109

And fleeing from night-haunting Pan o'er all the lonely ground,
Beneath its leaves a hiding-place the Dryad nymph has found.
Here Bacchus too his revels held, till fragrance filled the halls 3
And blither grew the shady boughs, as each libation falls:

 

And, underneath, the roses lay in gay confusion strown,
Plucked from the wreaths of yesterday‚ till no one knew his own.
' Ο ever by the gods beloved, O mighty Caesar's tree,
The doom of impious axe or flame need ne’er be feased by thee.
But thou unfading still may'st hope thy leafy crown to wear,
For 'twas not vanquished -Pompey's hand but Caesar's placed
thee there.
