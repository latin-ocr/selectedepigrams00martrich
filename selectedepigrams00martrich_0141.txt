X. 30.

ἱ Α description of the villa of his friend Apollinaris at Formiae, a watering-
place on the west coast of Italy. Salmacis was a spring that fell into the
Lucrine Lake.

When from the anxious cares and strife

That vex our Roman city life

 

Apollinaris fain would fly,

He, secking then thy temperate sky,
No other spot prefers to thee,

Thou pleasant shore of Formiae.
Not so famed Tibur's charming ease,
His virtuous consort’s home, can please 3
Not Tusculum's sequestered groves
Nor Algidum's so much he loves:
Not Antium's or Praeneste's air,

Nor witching Circe's headland fair3
Dardan Caieta, nor the flood

Of Liris, nor Marica's wood,

Nor watery SalmaciS‚ who laves

Her maiden limbs in Lucrine waves.
Here sea-born Thetis does not sleep
Unmoved, but breezes stir the deep,

Which on its peaceful ripples bears
Gay skiffs with aid of gentle airs,
