IV. 13.

On the happy marriage of Pudens and Claudia, perhaps the same as St.
,. Paul mentions in 2 Tim. iv. 21. Claudia appears, from another epigram
(xi. 53) to have been of British birth. Hence the allusion to the union
of the native (Massic') wine with the foreign (Athenian) honey, a mixture that

Ῑ formed a common Roman beverage.

 

Here, Hymen, here thy blessings shed‚
Bright burns thy torches' golden flame:

For Pudens doth with Claudia wed, -
The Roman lord and British dame.

How seldom nard its odours sweet
And cinnamon combine so well;

Or Massic wines so fitly meet
With juice of Atticv honey·cell!

Not with more grace do soft with brave—
Do tender vines with elms unite;

Nor better lotus loves the wave,
Or myrtles in their banks delight.

Fair on this marriage-conch the while,
A goddess bright‚ let Concord rest 3

And kindly still may Ve‘nus smile
On mutual love of pair so blest.

Him may her warrn affection cheer,

When youth on time's swift pinions flies;
And so may she, when age is near,

Seem never old to loving eyes,
