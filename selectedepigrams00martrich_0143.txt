As fresh and cool as those diffused
From purple fans by ladies used.
Nor need the angler seek his prey
Far out at sea, but here he may
His line from couch or sofa throw
To fish spied in the depths below.
'Or should* the ocean-god obey

Old Aeolus' tempestuous sway,
Your table, from its stores supplied,-
Laughs at the stormy billows' pride.
For in the well-stocked tank are fed
Turbot and pike your care has bred:

Choice lampreys there towards you swim3

Tame mullets to the water’s brim

And well-grown barbels make their way,
Their keeper's summons to obey.

But when does Rome to us permit
For these delights her walls to quit?
How many days does each year see
Spent free from care at Formiae?

How- than their masters luckier far
Our bailiffs and our porters are!

Tied fast to city life's annoy,
We pay for pleasures they enjoy.
