XII. 52.

To Sempronia, upon the death of her husband Rufus, a poet and orator.
She had, on some previous occasion, eloped from her husband, but had
returned to him. Hence the allusions to the rape of Helen by Paris, and of

’ Proserpine by Pluto.

He, famous erst as pleader for the oppressed,
Who wore a wreath plucked from the Muses' tree,
Lo! here thy Rufus dotb, Sempronia, rest,

Even in whose ashes glows his love for thee.

The Elysian fields thy happy story learn,
Helen herself doth marvel at the tale:
‘For thou, more true, didst to thy sponse return,

To bring her back not even did prayers prevail.

Now hears old Menelaus with a smile

Her love recounted for the Trojan youth,
And thinks she yet may come. His heart, the while,
*For Phrygian Paris groweth soft with ruth.

Hereafter when the blest abode is thine‚

No shade more famed shall in that hall be seen.
Such as thou art are loved by Proserpine 3

'Thy wifely love renewed hath won the queen.
