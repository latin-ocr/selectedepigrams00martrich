X. 614

An epitaph on the little Erotion on whom Epp⁴ v. 36, 37 were written.
The poet commends her tomb to the care of his successors. At certain
festivals, offerings of garlands, essences, &c. were placed on the grave, as

‚ tokens of pious affection.
l

Here lies Erotion in the shade
Of foliage planted newly.
In her sixth winter did she fade,

Cut off by fate unduly.

Thou, whosoe’er thou be, to whom
Ere long these fields I render,
The annual offerings at her tomb

Discharge 3 they are but slender.

So, son succeeding sire, from thee
No victims death shall borrowz
But on thy land this stone shall be

The only mark of sorrow,
