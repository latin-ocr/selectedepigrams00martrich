In order to promote marriage, certain privileges were granted by law to
persons who had not fewer than three children. These advantages were
sometimes, as in Martial's case, obtained unconditionally, by special favour

My lord's kind gift must not be thrown away.

’Tis Thais Quintus calls his dear.
Thais his dear? Pray, sir, which one? .
The one-eyed Thais. 'Faith‚ 'tis clear

She has but one eye, he has none. ,
