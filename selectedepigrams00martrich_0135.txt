IX. 68.

The poet complains of a noisy schoolmaster who kept him awake. The
instruction in the Roman schools began very early in the morning.

Sirrah, what mean you by this noise‚
You bane alike of girls and boys?

· Even ere cock-crow you can’t restrain
Your thundering voice and sounding cane.
Not braziers weld with so much force
A lawyer's statue to 'its horse 3
Not such a din the circus hears,

When loud the mob its champion cheers.
We neighbours ask not all the night

To sleep in peace till morning light 3 '
But all* night 'long awake to share

Your noise is more than fiesh can bear.
Dismiss your pupils. Since you’re paid
For carrying on this shouting trade,

Do you expect, you man of lung,

To get as much to hold your tongue?
