’ On a rich man who seigned illness that he might show off his costly bed-
} furniture to his friends who carne to visit him. Machaon, son of Aescula-
pius, was physician to the Greeks during the Trojan war.

Zoilus is ill: what brings his pains?
. His gorgeous quilts and counterpaneS.
For were he well, as Ι or you,
What would his grand bed—curtains do?
His mattress which the Niie supplies,
And hangings gay with Sidon's dyes?
What else but illness, caught by rule,
Displays the riches of a fool? vx
What boot your doctors? Send their way on
All those disciples of Machaon.
Wish you your health once more to gain?
V Be wise, and take my counterpane.

On a plagiarist.

Paullus buys poemS‚ and aloud,

 

As his, recites them to the crowd.
For what you buy* it is well known

You have a right to call your own.
