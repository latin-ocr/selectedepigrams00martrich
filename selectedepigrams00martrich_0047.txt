·’ FOR ENGLISH READERS. 23

II. 86.-

¹ The p'oet replies to the charge that he could not write verses with
curious metrical peculiarities, or effeminate poems like the Atys of Catullus.¹
This, he says, is like finding fault with a good runner for not being an
acrobat.

η’ Because Ι do not take delight
ἵ In poems that will backwards read,
Or to such dextrous rhymes give heed
As raliish Sotades could write·

Because, as Greeian poets use,
No verse among my writings shows
A foolish echo at its close3

Nor yet, with otherS, do I choose

To ape Catullus' famous theme

In galliambics' nerveless style :--

Ι am not therefore, friend, the while,
So poor a poet as you deem.

What folly were it to command
Ladas, in running lithe·of limb,
Against his will upon the rim

Of the revolving wheel to stand!

’T is mean and· foolish to assign
Long care and pains to trifles light„
Palaemon for the mob may wn'te,
To please ears fit and few be mine.
