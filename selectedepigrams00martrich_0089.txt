 

ΓΘΗ EN GLISH READERS.

To sweat you, ere you try the springs,
Hot air the lucid onyx flings;

While marbles streaked like serpent's hide
For you a milder warmth provide.

Or, if a. Spartan taste you own,
Content with heated air alone,

In bath as pure you then can lave
As Marcia's or the Virgin wave.

It shines so clear and spotless fair,
You’d think no water could be there;
But say the Lygdian marble bright
Was standing empty in your sight.
But all this while you will not hear,
And listen with a careless ear.

Since, OppianuS, this is 80,

Down to the grave unwashed you'll go.
