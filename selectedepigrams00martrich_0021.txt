measures of liquor were drunk by each guest as there were
s letters to his name. Allusions to this method of toasting are
common in our author. Thus in one of our epigrams
(an. 51, p. 93) Martial proposes to drink either four measures
to the name Rufe, the vocative case of thfus,· or seven

ι measures to the name Iustam, another form of Instantius ‚· or,

lastly, twelve measures to represent both his friend's names,

it. Hence the fondness of the first Caesar for wearing 3 1311161

23, p. 135, to invent glass eyes, though the ancients equalled and
even excelled us in many forms of glass manufacture.

Martial was by birth a Spaniard‚ and his life extends from
about A.D. 40 to A.D. 103. He came to Rome as a boy, and
