,ι XII. 94.
ἓ To Tucca, who persistently imitated Martial in every style of poetry that
4⁴ he adopted. Lucilius was the father of Roman Satire. The plectrum, or

quill, was an instrument for striking the strings of the lyre.

I tried my hand at epics: you
Forthwith began to write them too.
Whereat I stopped, for fear that I
Should with your verses seem to vie.

My sportive Muse would fain prepare
The tragic buskin next to wear:

 

When o'er your shoulders too I spy

The sweeping pall of Tragedy.

Driven thence, the lyre's sweet chords I stirred‚

Which erst Horatian music heard:

ἦ, You‚ not to be outrivalled still,

3 Snatch from my hand the lyric quill.

I venture satire: you again

Labour to hit Lucilius' vein.

⁷, I elegiae trifies write:

ὲ At once like trifles you indite.

ῖς . Then Ι, the last and least to take,
Light epigrams began to make:
You, nothing· loth, endeavour now
To pluck this laurel from my brow.
What style you do not wish for, choose:
You cannot all, in reason, use.
And if for one you should not care,
That, Tucca, leave me as my share.
